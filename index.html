      <h1>How trees help create fresh water</h1>
      <img src="images/tree.png" alt="Drzewo">
      <p> Trees and forests play a key role in producing the planetâ€™s fresh water supply, by both creating and attracting clouds, and by guiding rainwater into rivers, lakes and the underground water table. Restoring currently damaged land with tree planting is the most effective way to secure a continual supply of water for drinking, agriculture, and to support all life. Here are 4 major ways that trees manage the water cycle: 
      <ul>
          <li>Trees add moisture to the air and create clouds</li>
          <li>Trees also snow rainfall</li>
          <li>Trees help soak the water into the ground</li>
          <li>Trees keep rivers ans strems cool and protected</li>
      </ul>
